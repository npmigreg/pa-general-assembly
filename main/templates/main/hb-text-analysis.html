      <h4>Latent Dirichlet Allocation Results on House Bill Short Titles</h4>
      <p>The following list of topics are being generated from an LDA model constructed using short titles scraped from the PA General Assembly House Bills.
          With the current number of Bills held in the database, a model with ten topics and three words per topic was selected as optimal; refresh the page to
          run the model again and obtain new results.

    <div class="row mt-4 col-lg-10">
      <p>In addition to regular stop words, an exclusion list of words that frequently appeared in House Bill short titles but did not provide relevance to
        topic analysis was created, and those words were removed from the final documents used in LDA. For more insight into the methods used to produce these results,
        view the project Github.
